This directory should contain your private Google service account JSON (e.g., `sacred-flash-XXXX.json`) and any other secret files needed for rclone.

Do **not** commit actual credentials. Add your own JSON file here and keep it local. The `.gitignore` excludes everything in this folder except this README.
